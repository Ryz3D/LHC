# Some example programs

Don't worry, this code is not actually part of the LHC. These are some small samples you can compile either using `lhc -ic test.c -oa test.ass` (run only: `lhc -s -ic test.c`) or `gcc test.c`. The functions provided by the LHC are implemented in `lhc.h` for full compatibility to other compilers.
